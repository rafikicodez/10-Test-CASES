These 10 test cases can serve as a starting point for non-functional testing of the UI. By performing these tests, the team can ensure that the UI meets the quality standards and requirements set by the project stakeholders. It is essential to document the results of these tests and any issues encountered to enable tracking and resolution. With this approach, the team can catch any non-functional issues before releasing the product, resulting in a better user experience and increased customer satisfaction.
